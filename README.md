# Module-2-Network-Activity

So in this section we’re going to learn how to use Git (and start to use GitHub) for individual work, solo. We’ll learn how to work with remotes, manage repositories, and navigate GitHub permissions in the web UI.

## 2.1 

* [Watch: 2.1: Network activity](https://youtu.be/G7lrRGRS5o8)
* Exercise: Work with remotes
1. On the command line: create a repository from the command line called “individual-work.”
2. On GitHub.com, create a repository.
3. On GitHub.com, upload your first week’s assignments to the “Individual” repository.
4. Use the command line to bring the commits back down to your local repository.

## 2.2

## 2.3

* [Watch: 2.3 Branches](https://youtu.be/kQMhvjLFS28)

Exercise: [Re-create your assignment workflow](git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
1. With [Visualizing Git](git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/), you’ll see the ability to make commits and branches.
2. Choose an individual assignment from your course. 
3. Re-create the workflow you expect from your students to complete their assignment.
4. Take a screenshot of your result from the visualization tool and post it to the [Education Community](https://education.github.community/c/teachers/advisors).

## 2.4

* [Watch 2.4 Merge](https://youtu.be/eS9fwKJffCY) 
* Exercise: Wikipedia switcheroo
1. Create a repository on your desktop called ‘planets’ with a readme.md and commit it. 
2. Choose a Wikipedia page about a planet of your choice. 
3. Copy the first paragraph about the planet, paste it into your readme.md and commit it.
4. Create a new branch (git branch <branchname>) and switch to it (git checkout <branchname>).
5. In atom, add Wikipedia entry about another planet into that branch’s readme. 
6. Save, then commit, then close out of atom.
7. Does the file show your first planet? Or the second?
8. Take a screenshot of your output and post it to the [Education Community](https://education.github.community/c/teachers/advisors).

## 2.5 

* [Watch 2.5: Managing student repositories](https://youtu.be/MjYiNdFsvzI)
* Exercise: How might you imagine using this tool for your courses?
* Exercise: Workflow
1. Will you keep all course materials in a repository? Or just assignments?
2. When will you expect students to commit? 
3. What sort of commit messages should they use?
4. When do you want your students to push their code to GitHub?
* Exercise: Distributing assignments
1. Create an organization with your course materials for one assignment in a repository.
2. Create a Classroom, and an individual assignment.
3. Send it to a colleague to accept. 
4. Take a snapshot of your teacher dashboard and post it to the [Education Community](https://education.github.community/c/teachers/advisors).
